>Responsible data is: "The duty to ensure people’s rights to consent, privacy security and ownership around the information processes of collection, analysis, storage, presentation and reuse of data, while respecting the values of transparency and openness.”

_Responsible Data Forum, working definition, September 2014._

##Basic principles

Engaging with responsible data practices means upholding a certain set of ethical practices with regards to the way you use data. As the use of digital and mobile information becomes more commonplace in international development programming, we are only beginning to understand the implications that real-time information, data trails and information + communication technologies (ICTs) pose for relationships with and between the people and communities these projects aim to serve.

The power dynamics created by use of technology, or more specifically, of data, can complicate the ways in which we understand well-established norms like participation, consent, right to information and the freedoms of expression, association and privacy. Responsible data is a set of practices and considerations that aims to address these challenges in a practical sense, to help projects enhance the good they aim to do, and to avoid inadvertant harm. 

At its base, understanding why responsible data is needed can be understood as a combination of empowerment and avoidance of harm:

**Empowerment**: We use data and technology to produce and mobilise appropriate information, to ensure that policies take everyone into account, especially focusing upon marginalised communities, and place the person in question as central to the data universe rather than as a tangential bystander or even byproduct, empowering users to be active participants rather than passive data "subjects".

**Harm avoidance**: We do all we can to ensure that we do no harm and that the way in which we use data and technology does not facilitate or exacerbate harm done by others.  

These norms are important for practitioners in the international development space because of our close and active engagement with some of the world's most vulnerable communities. As development programmes increasingly adopt innovative technical tools to achieve their objectives, the great potential of technology and data is accompanied by a professional, and moral, responsibility to protect the safety of those around us. Warranted or not, there is a level of moral responsibility held by organisations who claim to be helping the world's poorest people improve their lives. With great data comes great responsibility.

When we commit to managing data responsibly, we do so to improve our work and support of the work of those around us; to improve the lives of others; to avoid doing or enabling harm, and to actively pursue a positive effect on the world around us. Responsible data is not just about technical security and encryption, but about prioritising dignity, respect and privacy of the people we work with, and making sure that the people reflected in the data we use are counted and heard, and able to make informed decisions about their lives. 

##What could go wrong?

We don't know much about how data-driven projects can go wrong until they go terribly wrong. There are strong incentives not to share experiences of responsible data harm, and those who share stories, especially of dramatic harm, usually don't wish to be attributed. Nontheless, there are a number case studies described in this guide that illustrate the breadth of harm that can result from irresponsible data practices. Here are some broad examples of things that can go wrong: 

**Individals can be harmed** physically, emotionally or financially. When personally identifiable information is leaked in sensitive contexts it can spark violence, discrimination, or exclusionary policies. 

**Groups can be harmed** without individuals ever being identified, through the enactment of discriminatory policies on the basis of data, on the basis of perceived relationships, or through subtle social dynamics or engineering. 

**Project credibility and relationships** with local partners and beneficiaries can be harmed when stakeholders feel as though they are exploited for data without receiving benefits, or when projects have adverse and unintended consequences. 

**Organisational brands and efficiency can be harmed**, with negative consequences for funding, legal liability, high level policy discussions, or credibility with public institutions or the audience they seek to serve. 

It takes just one tactical oversight, one data breach, or one mistakenly-collected dataset to put people in danger or damage critical relationships or organisational brands. You'll see throughout the book a number of case studies illustrating the scope of responsible data harm. Many of these are based on real-life experiences, and they are intended to highlight the sometimes frightening ease with which these situations arise. As with many of life's bad experiences - they can happen to any of us, at any time.

Whether the harm is dramatic and clear, such as violence and death, or more subtle and nuanced such as changes in social dynamics, this book aims to provide entry points and guidance for identifying and mitigating these risks before they occur. 

##Arguments for speaking about responsible data with peers and management

Responsible data requires input and engagement across project teams and significant investments of time, energy and resources. This, in turn, will require getting many different types of people on board, and may require you to "sell" the idea up the management chain, convincing key decision makers of the value that can accrue and the necessity for proactive thinking and strategising on the topic. 

This may require careful thought about different audiences, what drivers might engage them and motivate them to act, and what messaging might best filter through the organisation to embed these practices and approaches. Below are a few arguments that might be useful to begin discussions. 

**Developing a responsible data policy sends a clear signal**to staff, donors and potential partner organisations about the organisation's progressive attitude and moral stance. Increasingly, donors are looking out for this, aware of increasing risks of security breaches and the reach of technology within the global development sector, and the growing ICT4D movement. 

**Taking clear steps towards responsible data practice demonstrates thought leadership** within the sector and a clear awareness of the rapidly changing technological landscape in which we work. To be clear though, implementing such a policy within a large (I)NGO is no mean feat; it will require ongoing training, regular updating of the policy, and rethinking and reshaping of projects, but, as we have outlined already, it is without a doubt a necessary step. Whether you choose to take that step now or later is of course up to you; but the longer you leave it, the more people's wellbeing is put at risk. 

**Incorporating responsible data practices into project design is, simply, good project design**. Addressing responsible data considerations when thinking about scope, audience, goals, risks, rewards and mitigation will help projects to anticipate challenges before they arrive, and assist project leaders to plan accordingly, with positive consequences for the allocation of resources - human, financial and technical.

**Responsible data practices make for more impactful programming**. When done well, a responsible approach to data in programming can be hugely transformative and capable of disrupting or democratising existing structural inequalities. It can result in internal benefits to organisations as well as systemic or environmental benefits within the area in which you are operating. It can minimize the extent and the nature of harm if/when something does go wrong, and it can contribute to a larger ecosystem founded not just on Do No Harm but on Do Good.

You may find that when discussing these issues with management and with colleagues, people assume that responsible data will come at a cost to some other important strategic objective. Generally, these tensions are worth discussing in groups. Working together to agree on the non-negotiable elements involved will generally help to identify responsible data practice, and is an important first step towards getting team members onboard.

##Perceived tensions you might come across

**Transparency, openness and responsibility**. There is a superficial contradiction between absolute transparency and absolute protection of individual privacy. At close look and in specific instances, this will often reveal itself to be a fundamental but manageable tension. When discussing specifics, it's rare to find a case where thoughtful, dedicated and informed people won't agree on what is permissible and what isn't permissible when promoting transparency and accountability. There is a key difference between personal data and data that should be made open: as a broad rule, we believe that the right to privacy is for those without power, and transparency is for those with power. 

**Efficiency and responsibility**. Often, objections to processes around responsible data will be hidden within objections to efficiency from the project implementer's perspective. Securing informed consent involves telling people about risks, and might decrease participation in a survey. De-identifying data may require external expertise and additional resources, delaying data release and delaying advocacy timelines. Humanitarian and other high pressure projects may feel that they should be exempt from all responsible constraints, since their work is, essentially, life and death. These tensions should also be addressed in the specific rather than the abstract, and teams should expect that they can agree on where to draw the red lines of what is absolutely not permissible and what benchmarks must be maintained. However, remember that respecting people's privacy rights is part and parcel of respecting their human rights, respecting these rights isn't an either/or, it's a must. 

**Representation and responsibility**. Projects that aim to represent and amplify the voices of marginalised communities may struggle with the idea that some information about those groups should not be made public. The argument is sometimes made that it might be necessary to make some concessions in the pursuit of larger benefits; for example, causing some social discomfort or small harm in order to promote the position of a marginalised group, or empowering them to claim their rights.
