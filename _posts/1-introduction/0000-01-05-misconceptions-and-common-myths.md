If you are working with data and want to speak about the importance of responsible data, you may run into a number of recurring ideas that get into the way of moving this discussion forward - be it within your organization or in your interaction with other stakeholders, such as donors or beneficiaries of your projects.

Below are a number of those we have encountered so far and would like to address:

>It is not my job, the IT department has this covered.

Actually, IT staff don't always understand these challenges very well either; they likely have a whole other set of tasks to prioritise. And, no matter how intelligent or diligent they are, responsible data challenges take place in a no man's land where political processes meet digital information flows, where no one is an expert. The only way to responsibly address these challenges is to do so across expertise and project teams, and to think hard about every step of the data lifecycle - often in complicated information environments. 

Privacy isn't important to people who are struggling to survive, it's a Western luxury that shouldn't be forced on us.

Everyone is entitled to basic human rights, and privacy rights (or digital rights) are just part of these. Responsible data is simply a way of understanding how best to respect the privacy rights of those around us.  If the concept or the word 'privacy' is problematic, there are many other ways of framing it: respecting human rights, using information respectfully, being safe in the digital world. The consequences of violating someone's privacy rights could be just as serious as violating their other human rights - for example, leading to physical violence or preventing them from access to vital services.

>This is needless handwringing; no one has really ever been harmed by data.

False. There are actually a number of real life examples where irresponsible data practices have led to people being subjected to physical violence, in the extreme cases leading to multiple deaths, or discriminatory policies and infrastructure, and damaged credibility and relationships with projects. You'll read about some of them in this Toolkit. 

>All this hand wringing doesn't help, in fact it's distracting us from all the amazing things that data can do to improve livelihoods.

Responsible data isn't a zero sum game. Sometimes there are trade-offs to make, but it's generally possible to work within international development responsibly and without doing harm. It does require effort and investment though, and until organizations and individuals make a commitment to begin internalizing responsible data practices, there will likely continue to be accidental harm. 

>All our data is all encrypted, so it's fine.

There are some great technological tactics that we can use to improve our digital security - but it's rarely infallible. You could encrypt your hard drive in case someone steals it - but what if they steal it, then use physical threats to get the password?

>It is all anonymised, so there's nothing to worry about.

Taking names out of data doesn't make it anonymous. There are multiple tactics for re-identifying data, and we have recently seen several instances where presumably anonymous data sets were combined with powerful algorithms to identify individuals and their online activity. This phenomenon, called the Mosaic effect, is especially problematic because it's not possible to estimate the chances that any given data set can be re-identified, because it's not possible to anticipate all the data sets that might be produced and meshed with it. Let alone the impossibility of anticipating what kinds of data sets might be made available in the future... 

>This data is not sensitive.

Not sensitive for whom? Perhaps not for you, but have you asked the people who are reflected in the data whether they think it's sensitive? Will it be sensitive a year from now? What if the government changes, if political tensions are exacerbated or if discriminatory legislation is passed? 

>The people handling our data are absolutely trustworthy and have the best of intentions.

Even if that's true and will remain true in changing contexts, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Responsible data challenges are complicated and require a thoughtful approach from multiple perspectives and expertise, not simply relying on the goodwill of a few individuals - human errors happen all the time, and it's best to have multiple strategies as a back up.

>I don't have time for this right now; I have other priorities.

This, especially in international development, is almost always the case; we're working in high pressure environments. But just think what would happen if that data set got leaked, or malicious actors got their hands on something they shouldn't... you could be putting the lives of the people you're trying to help, at serious risk.
