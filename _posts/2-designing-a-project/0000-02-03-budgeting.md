Sometimes, treating data responsibly in your project will cost money and resources. If it's too late to include responsible data considerations in the budget, you will be in the awkward (and potentially dangerous) position of deciding whether or not to be responsible; this could mean compromising on other goals, or coming up with makeshift approaches that may be unsustainable. Plan ahead for those budget lines that often are easily forgotten. 

##Technology

Which technologies do you plan to use? Work out what you need before choosing a platform: be sure it has the functionality you need (or, if open source, that you can customise it accordingly) to grow along with your program and that you have budgeted for development, testing, maintenance and support. What will be the cost of using/replacing your technology in 1 year? 3 years? 5 years?

Does this technology meet your responsible data needs in terms of accessibility and security? Is the technology appropriate for the people who should be able to access it in terms of culture, literacy and media access? No technology is ever 100% secure, but technology that has been independently audited will have fewer vulnerabilities than non-audited counterparts. If your data is very sensitive, it may be more responsible to audit software before using it. This costs money, so ensure to budget for it.

##Support

Whenever you are relying on an external provider, especially for hosting or software, you will need support. There may be things that don't work, and there will be things that you only realise you will need after using a system for a longer time. Make sure that this support is covered in the agreement with your provider, or negotiate a support package included in the budget. Ensure that service levels and response times are appropriate for your way of working (eg. a 9-5pm solution for the UK may not be ideal if you are a real time crisis mapping organisation with a global footprint.) 

Failing to think about these things in advance brings the risk that you will be running a system that you have considerable second-thoughts or grievances about, just because you cannot pay your provider more. As a business, they may well be unable to provide this support on a pro-bono basis, no matter how urgent or critical the need. Be sure to request non-standard packages that work for you; most providers offer non-profit rates and/or are able to support a fair price especially if their wider pool of customers can benefit from the tweaks or system improvements from your feedback and advice. 

##CASE STUDY: Vendor Abandonment or Planning for Emergency Data Migration

An NGO has an internal policy of using free and open-source applications for data collection, mainly because of the accessibility factor (low/no cost). Many of this NGO's projects have invested in using this application to design their project workflows, and have stored large amounts of data on the application server. The group who created the application decided to abandon the work for a new venture and the existing application was left unsupported. This resulted in the NGO losing access to their data for over a month during an emergency. Beneficiaries who had come to depend on the NGO's projects were left without service provision during a time of crisis. If the lack of vendor support was identified in the risk assessment, it's possible emergency/contingency planning could have allowed for a quicker recovery (e.g. emergency data migration) from this unfortunate situation.  

##Hosting and Data Storage

Storing and hosting your data does not come for free and it is important to consider the cost over time in relation to how your programme may grow (look beyond year 1). Try not to take the inexpensive option simply because it is tempting to get hosting for 5 USD per month, although there may be instances where this is totally fine. Make sure your hosting is suitable for your needs, that is it is hosted with a provider you can trust or with competent systems administrators within your organisation. That usually means you will have a reliable backup system, regular monitoring of logs and swift updates of software to fix known security holes.

##Skills and Training

Making sure that the people in your organisation have the skills they need is an essential, though often ignored, part of a project. This involves identifying the skills that need to be associated with specific people and specific roles, but also ensuring that no mission-critical skills are siloed with one particular 'expert' on a topic - what happens if they leave?

Do staff need security awareness training before setting out on data collection?
Do your project managers have adequate data literacy skills? 
What do technical staff need to know about the communities you are working with, for example when designing the technical infrastructure you'll be using?
Addressing these kinds of questions when designing a project can help to enable appropriate responses to responsible data challenges, as well as generally ensure project sustainability and professional development for supporting staff.

Ongoing training can also be an important investment, to manage the risks posed by staff turnover and changing contexts.

##Backup Planning and Emergency Support

Even with the very best planning, emergency situations may arise that will need immediate response and support. Though it's impossible to plan for everything, leaving some budget for these emergencies will enable your team to be more resilient. There is an almost never-ending range of emergency situations to consider for your project, of which examples might include:

- recently changed threatening legislation
- government crackdowns
- violent acts and injury 
- imprisonment
- loss of equipment
- vendor abandonment

Responding to these unexpected challenges might require many different kinds of resources, from external advocacy support, to emergency medical funds, litigation and legal support, increased security funds, or tool replacement funds. It is important to remember that these situations are usually extremely time sensitive and turn-around time will need to be as quick as possible; financial bottlenecks should be reduced to a minimum.

##Quality and Integrity Assurance

Trust is important, but sometimes you will need to verify that best practices are being followed. At what stages in your project do you need to assure the quality of the work being done, in order to not let any irresponsible habits slip in? This can happen at the data collection stage (especially if you rely on interns, volunteers or short-term contractors), during data migrations and verification, or when data is analysed. Better safe than sorry, so factor in time and human resources to avoid unpleasant surprises when it is too late and the consequences are real, not theoretical.

##Project Termination

Data-driven or data-supported projects beg one important question: what happens to the data when the project ends? Does the data have an expiry date? Where will it be archived? Might users ask for copies of their data? If so, are you in a position to provide it, both financially and in terms of process? Make sure you plan in advance and have the appropriate budget to terminate the data, or to migrate it internally or to external partners as is appropriate.
