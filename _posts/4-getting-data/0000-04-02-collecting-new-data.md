##Designing a data collection process

Designing the data collection process requires asking basic questions about roles, tools and timing. This section needs to be informed by the **risk assessment** conducted during project design (see Don't panic, plan.), but reviewed in detail here for your own project, to carefully consider responsible data challenges that might surface by the particulars of your data collection. To begin understanding what data collection methods will responsibly produce the data required by your project, review the following questions:

- **What** are you collecting and **why** are you collecting it? How does this relate to your research question? Have this clear from the beginning of your design as it helps you throughout the process in making the right choices and changes.
- **Who provides the data**? Did you get their **consent** for this specific use?
- Who will collect the information? Ensure they are appropriate in relation to the specific identities of your participants (e.g. gender, race, class, language, etc.)
- **How will you collect the data**? Establish a clear data collection process – will data collectors perform data entry in front of responders or after a conversation with responders? Consider the impact of the data collection method on the desired conversational outcomes between the data collector and respondents (e.g. conversations about sensitive topics shouldn’t be interrupted by the data collection tool; do what you can to remove external factors that might act as inhibitors for respondents). 
- **How often will the data be collected**? Will the same participants be polled repeatedly? How will frequency interact with other timeframes important to the community in question? What implications will this have for project resources and for data validity?
- Take careful consideration of the **tools** you will use to perform data collection. In some cases, paper is a good option if using electronic devices will create suspicion or risk. But also consider that in some cases, electronic devices can be password protected and encrypted to protect the data in ways that paper cannot.
- **How will you transfer and store the data**? Will the the data collected need to be centralised? In some cases, decentralised data is appropriate because the data is mainly operational and serves a short-lived purpose. If you plan to centralise the data, consider the data flow process from data collection to centralisation. What is the desired frequency of data centralisation? How secure is the data centralisation process, and what additional risks may arise from centralisation? 

##Defining challenge areas - an exercise

###Step 1: Come up with a detailed data collection plan

The questions above can be used to define specific challenge areas for your project. You might want to create a table to map your steps, adding specific approaches and challenges that might arise for each. It would be best if done in a group, on a big sheet of paper. The table below shows examples of what specific approaches might involve.

<table>
	<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>CHALLENGES</th>
        <th>POTENTIAL RISKS</th>
		<th>POTENTIAL RESPONSES</th>
	</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
            <tr>
             	<td>Personal privacy and anonymity</td>
	            <td></td>
				<td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
             	<td>Agency and data empowerment</td>
	            <td></td>
				<td></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Social impact of data collection</td>
	            <td></td>
				<td></td>
            </tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

###Step 2: Brainstorm risks and responses

When you have identified some of the specifics, talk about some of the common responsible data challenge areas, such as identification and the social impact of data collection. Do any of these prompt concerns about the methods that you are planning to use to collect data? Write down any potential risks that occur to the team during discussion and note any potential responses that might help to manage those risks. 

<table>
	<thead>
	<tr>
		<th>DIMENSION</th>
          <th>SPECIFIC APPROACH</th>
	</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>FROM WHOM</td>
              <td>All adults</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>HOW</td>
              <td>Household surveys, conducted in the local language</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
              <td>WHO</td>
              <td>Local enumerators, hired through the national university</td>
            </tr>
			<tr>
              <td>HOW OFTEN</td>
              <td>Annually</td>
            </tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

##Deciding what data to collect

###Data minimums and unanticipated use

When deciding what data to collect, consider the minimum amount of data necessary to reach the project goals in balance with the data you may want to collect for unanticipated uses. While many development programmes track clearly defined indicators, there may be an impulse to collect additional data outside of indicator tracking for operational or research purposes. It is important to refer back to your risk assessment to inform these decisions.

###Red lines - what not to collect, and what never to collect

Be clear about the information you will not collect due to relevance, sensitivities, and risk. Think about unanticipated uses of the data and potential harm/risk.

In general, when thinking about what data to collect or not to collect, these are the most important aspects to consider:

**Leave it out**: Do you really need the names, ages and exact locations? The rationale for collection should be that it needs to be necessary to achieve your goals; not just that it would make things easier for you, or save you time. Often you can reconcile this by collecting less fine-grained data. Sometimes it means you will decide to refrain from collecting some data completely. 

**Metadata**: This is data describing your data, for example the time a photo has been taken or the camera that was used. This metadata can reveal a lot of the information that you were deliberately not collecting, or that you want to protect. If this is the case, make purging of metadata part of the collection process from the very beginning, or configure the tools you are using to not create it in the first place.

**Surveillance**: While you are collecting data, you are not always alone, and when someone is passively or actively watching you, they can fill in the gaps. Depending on your risk assessment, this means you need to take appropriate measures to conceal your traces in the collection process, alter collection methods, or not collect the data at all.

##Live Data Processes

Some projects will use "live data", which is collected, accessed, reviewed, used and updated on a continual basis. Examples of such projects include service delivery projects, or projects that are case-based, in which several different team members have access to individual's data and records. These systems can be especially challenging, as they compress the project data cycle, and force individual team members to adopt a variety of roles and responsibilities when relating to potentially sensitive data. 

###Roles and responsibilities

The first step is to clearly define **who should have access to exactly what data at which point**. For example, during the registration process, you may have intake staff (consider maybe these staff are volunteers or interns) who should be able to create new registration records but should not have access to detailed assessment information (which may contain sensitive information) about the subject. In this example, it could be that only case workers should have access to detailed assessment information on the subject. If referring a subject to another agency, that agency may receive a specific sub-set of information on the subject as to protect sensitive or non-relevant information. 

###Access to data throughout the micro-cycle

In addition to defining roles and permissions during the service delivery period, you should also define roles and responsibilities throughout the project lifecycle. Consider who will handle data (and who should not) during data collection, data management (storing, cleaning, analysing), and internal data sharing. Do you have data administrators who will oversee the data workflow and support data access and flow according to the plan you've defined?

###Reference/storage/management

Inevitably, data will be stored on multiple platforms throughout the data lifecycle. Consider the various tools used for data collection (mobile device, web form, paper, etc.), data storage (mobile device, laptop, centralized database, paper, etc.), data cleaning/analysis (Excel spreadsheet, database, reporting platform, etc.) and ensure there is a safety and security plan for each of the various platforms used. 

##Common ways of collecting data

There are many methods of collecting data, and each one comes with its own challenges. When choosing the data collection tools and processes you will use, think about how it can affect your message and what type of influence it might have when interacting with the participants.

**Web-based surveys**: There are a number of popular survey platforms available. From a functional perspective, it is important that they do what you need them to do, while not blowing your budget. However, you also need to ensure that they provide your participants with reasonably secure access (for example at least an https connection), so they are not transmitting sensitive information over unencrypted channels.

Moreover, if you are using an external provider, ensure that ideally they have no access to the data themselves, and cannot be legally compelled to hand it over without notifying you and allowing you to challenge that order. Refer to the data management chapter on more legal and practical considerations when working with external providers.

**Mobile phone surveys**: Mobile phone surveys are a great way to reach many participants fast with relatively low cost and a relatively low access barrier.

However, you are critically relying on existing infrastructure that is outside your control - the mobile phone network. That means, you are relying on telecommunications companies to follow responsible procedures, as all information passes through them; not to forget the huge amount of metadata that they will undoubtedly be in possession of: for example, the location the SMS was sent from, to whom, and times. They may be legally compelled to hand out either the metadata, or the data itself, to government authorities. 

Consequently, you need to assess whether the phone network operator can be trusted, when thinking about using mobile phone surveys. 

**In-person surveys using mobiles or tablets**: these surveys follow the same dynamics as interviews - it may be necessary to establish a safe space for the participant and a situation of trust where they can give informed consent. 

On the positive side, often you have more means of securing the data on devices, compared to working with paper. However, you need to ensure the devices are properly secured, in particular by encrypting their storage and establishing strong passwords. In addition to this, ensure there is a clear and secure way to process the data from the devices into the management system, and check who else has access to the data stored on these devices. 

##Quick checklist for tools, security and training

- Consider the pros and cons of using open source tools for the project (cost, customisability, independent audit, support)
- Do some features of the tools you have chosen present security challenges? If so, can they be managed or closed?
- Will data collectors need to edit their data/information after the fact? If so, ensure the technology supports the desired level of data editing, and ideally, that it records any changes made. 
- Ensure selected tools allow for your desired range of data access permissions: will you need people with various levels of permissions to interact with specified sets of data? (see section: for your eyes only) 
- Establish a response plan for potential emergency technical challenges (phones breaking, no wifi, etc.) and have support ready to go.
- Establish a response plan in case tools are confiscated or lost (eg. being able to wipe the data remotely)
- Consider using strong encryption software with good end-to-end implementation to protect data and communications content.
- Consider built-in protection features within your selected technology (e.g. device encryption) and their potential vulnerabilities
- Ensure staff have received appropriate training on the established informed consent process and are aware of ethical considerations around conducting research on other people
- Ensure staff have received appropriate training on data security for secure data management with devices that they will be using– password best practices, anonymised data, device security, etc.
- Have a process for reporting incidents, to provide care for your staff, as well as affected participants.

Note that this checklist is likely not to be exhaustive, but covers frequently observed blind spots.
