Sometimes, it is easy to get caught up in the technical aspects of collecting and managing data, and forget that we are working with information about human beings and their lives. It is crucial to be responsible, open, transparent and inclusive in the data collection process, creating clear mechanisms for engagement and feedback, and always keeping in mind who is being described and who, ultimately, should have the last word. 

##Representation

Data is a very powerful tool in telling a narrative about peoples' lives and realities. We need to understand how these narratives may impact people's lives, and be responsible in the ways we use and present this data. Given that it is important that data is used in the narrative responsibly, there are two aspects to consider:

**Inclusion**: Data can never represent all people and all nuances of a cultural or social mosaic; no matter how big the sample size used, it is vital to remember that data is inherently exclusive and rarely, if ever, tells the whole story. If we ignore the very possible exclusions in data we risk perpetuating social inequalities. When collecting or finding data, ask yourself: who does the data leave out? Who is not reflected in this data and what impact might that have on their lives when using that data for programming, advocacy or policy change?

**Accuracy**: Data needs to be as accurately reflective as possible of the reality of the people involved. Otherwise, the narrative that is developed from the data can be harmful for those people. The accuracy aspect is mainly about ensuring that the right questions are being asked: there are many elements of data accuracy that fall into the realm of research methods and techniques of data collection and so fall outside of the scope of this book. Bear in mind also that "accuracy" is inherently subjective. 

##Consent

The concept of consent is so central, it occupies a full chapter in this book, and we will only mention it briefly here. One of the first steps involved in getting data, is making sure that the people who are reflected in that data and who might be providing that data give permission for you to collect and use the data. This permission needs to be informed and given willingly, without feeling as though their other basic rights are at risk if they refuse consent. There are debates as to whether or not consent is always appropriate or achievable, and there are different levels of consent. Consent is a keystone to responsible data, and details on it are given in the relevant chapter. 

##Ownership

Who owns the actual data, and what does that mean for the people involved? Many detailed laws and regulations exist, governed by legal frameworks around ownership of data. There is a growing debate on how traditional regulatory frameworks apply to the new data ecosystems. As these bigger debates settle, there are a few **ethical issues** we should think about that are broader than legal ownership. Ultimately, data belongs to the individual that the data describes, as they have the right to withhold consent and to remove thier data from the process.

However, there are a few problems with this: given the different types of data that exist, active data ownership is not always feasible.  For instance, census data is often mandated by national law and an individual cannot opt out of being counted. Many forms of big data also have very complicated opt-out mechanisms, if they have any at all. This makes it very difficult for individuals to claim or retain effective ownership. Some basic questions to ask in this regard are:

Does the individual have control over how their data is used?
Do they have power to stop the data from being used in a certain way?
Are they aware of how the data will be used and is there a way to communicate changes in data use?
How are we accountable to the people reflected in the data? How is this accountability enforced?
There are also important issues to address regarding the power dynamics that emerge during the use of and collection of data. These are discussed in greater detail in the chapter The world of data) 

##Transparency

Transparency might seem to be the counterbalance to privacy and security; in reality the two concepts are perfectly compatible, and effectively two sides of the same coin, as long as they both work towards **empowerment and protection of people**. Transparency calls for disclosure: keeping an open and easily accessible account of methodology, intent of data use, who will use it and for how long, as well as how the data, the analyses and the learnings will be shared, and with whom. There should be a minimum list of data areas that can be safely disclosed. Specific instances in which this could prove to be important are donor reporting, monitoring and evaluating programs. Privacy should be granted to those without power: transparency should be demanded of those with power. 

Information is power and as is commonly repeated, with great power comes great responsibility. It is important to think of transparency in terms of how the data is being released, and whether all necessary steps to protect individuals have been taken into account. Is data anonymised and assessed for identification risks, or is the information for advocacy work where these identities need to be disclosed? What is the most responsible way to navigate this scenario? Ultimately, **the responsiblity of making this choice lies with you**.
