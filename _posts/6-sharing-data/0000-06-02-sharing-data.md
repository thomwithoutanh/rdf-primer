After considering the points in the previous chapter, you may have come to the conclusion that your data can be responsibly released into the wild, at some level. The next sections are designed to help you think about the different groups you can share with, and the appropriate checks and balances you should consider for each level of dissemination.

##Sharing internally (within your organisation) 

Perhaps the data that you have collected will be of particular interest to your colleagues, who might be working on similar issues, or within the same country or region. This is a relatively restricted level of sharing - just within your own organisation, department or formally organised consortia or partners.

Be aware of the blind spots that internal sharing often entails: you are probably seeking feedback from like-minded individuals who know where you're coming from, understand the issues you're dealing with, and know what to look for. They will be able to provide you with vital feedback, validation of assumptions, and will understand the importance of keeping the data safe and secure in this very sensitive first phase. But they will likely be sharing your own biases and won't be able provide truly independent feedback. 

The wider you go within your organisation (or consortium/partnership), the more diverse feedback will be, bringing with it truly fresh perspectives come in. However, the wider you go, the less control you have. An important aspect of this level of sharing is the presence of an organisational security policy: a set of rules and guidelines providing you with a framework that you can safely assume your colleagues, partners or co-workers, will follow when dealing with the data.  [See section Data consent, for your eyes only... ]

 TOOLS: collaborative tools, private Github repos, etc

##Controlled closed sharing

Another sharing option might be to share the data with people outside of your own organisation, but to retain some level of control. It's worth bearing in mind that for most NGOs, this almost always has to be a smaller and tighter data set than what can be shared in the earlier stage: this will be easier if you have already had input from those fresh perspectives we mentioned above.

For example, the data could be shared with peers for external opinion, or even data aggregation, in case they are working on similar themes (beware of combining apples and pears when combining different data sets, however). 

>Data aggregation is a crucial point of risk assessment: sometimes standalone data deemed safe becomes harmful when combined with other data sets, or data that you thought was anonymised becomes easily discernible once combined with other data, using triangulation techniques. (see section: anonymising data) 
Another reason for sharing externally is the advantage of getting different expertise. Sharing data with other organisations can help to recognise the gaps in your data set, making for a more resilient and more trustworthy data set. It is all too easy to unknowingly apply your own personal biases when collecting data (for example, within questions asked in surveys, or structuring of the data), and sharing it with people who weren't involved in early stages might help to identify these biases. 

One last aspect to mention here is the **sanity check**: sharing your data with unusual suspects will provide you with opinions that are outside of the echo chamber you are used to, and can help to expand the dimensions of your project. You could, for example, share the data back with the people reflected in the data, and see what they think of what it reveals. Often, doing this is a responsible thing to do anyway.

When connecting with external organisations, it might be useful (or sometimes, organisationally mandated) to put in place legal constraints of how your data will be used. Tools like a non-disclosure agreement can provide legal leverage for ensuring your data is not misused, or that it is treated safely, and doesn't get shared any wider than you are envisioning. 

When collaborating using the same tools, software will often allow you to configure access permissions or check logs for suspicious activity. This will not help you prevent leakage, but will help you identify any proactively, which will in turn allow you to take measures for containing damage.

 TOOLS: Non-disclosure agreements, Memorandum of Understanding, collaborative software  

##The point of no return

So you want to **publish** your data - at this point, you're most likely talking about a smaller, more controlled portion of your data, which you have carefully checked for any weak points, sensitive points, inaccuracies, and biases.

Once the data set is shared publicly, the proverbial cat is out of the bag. Any weak point in the information, any personally identifiable information that hasn't been properly addressed, will be impossible to mitigate because someone might have already made a copy. The sections above offer a strong validation and checkup process; however, a **final risk assessment** of the data is more than warranted.

If you're at this point, your data set has likely changed since the very first version you might have been working with, and is hopefully more robust and secure now, it might also be that some aspects have slipped through the cracks.

There's another group that need to get back to at this point: the people who are reflected in the data, or the **data subjects**. Before publishing information that, however unlikely, might put individuals at risk of harm, you should set up procedures to connect either directly with the involved people, or with representatives of communities you are collecting data from, to get their final go-ahead before data is published.

If you are confident that the data is ready for sharing with the world, please proceed to the next chapter: [publishing data](http://primer.responsibledata.io/sharing-data/publishing-data.html).
